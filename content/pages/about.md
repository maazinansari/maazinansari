My name is Maazin Ansari. Welcome to my site!

I made this site to showcase work I've done in courses and on my free time.
It will contain anything from data analysis to visualizations to maps to tutorials and personal reflections.
For more information on my professional experience, see [my resume here]({filename}/static/Maazin-Ansari-Resume.pdf).

# Background

I have always been fascinated with data and visualizations, especially geographic data and maps.
That fascination is what led me to study Statistics and Geography/GIS at the University of Illinois.
Shortly after graduating in 2018 I started working as a data analyst at [MÃ©rieux NutriSciences](https://digital-solutions.merieuxnutrisciences.com/en/content/qualmap).
There, I developed technical and professional skills while continuing to explore my interests in data analysis.

Now I am looking to start the next chapter in my journey in data analysis and statistics.
In particular, I am looking for opportunities to learn more about data science and operations research.

# About this blog

I started this blog between late 2017 and early 2018. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience to set up.
I use Pelican to create and organize it. I also use some scripts to manage my workflow.

Most of the content on this site will be in R-based.
It's the language I am most comfortable using, especially for making blog posts with RMarkdown.

Soon, I'll make a proper tutorial about how I made this site, from start to finish.
For now, you can find useful files I use to make this site on [my GitHub](https://github.com/maazinansari/maazinansari).

I plan on doing a lot with this site. Stay tuned!
