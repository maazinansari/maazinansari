My name is Maazin Ansari and I am an undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
pursuing degrees in statistics and geography/GIS. I am set to graduate in May 2018, and am currently exploring options for the future.

I made this site to showcase work I've done in courses and on my free time.
It will contain anything from data analysis to visualizations to maps to tutorials and personal reflections.
For more information on my professional experience, see [my resume here]({filename}/static/Maazin-Ansari-Resume.pdf).

# Background

I first got interested in data analysis when I took AP Statistics in high school.
The summer after graduation I had an idea for a project that introduced me to GIS.
In college, I decided to double major in both statistics and GIS, and I haven't looked back.
That decision led me to valuable internships where I applied what I'd learned in professional settings.

Since I started, I've learned how to use R, ArcGIS, QGIS, and Python.
Most of the content on this site will be from R.
I find it the easiest to work with, especially for making blog posts with RMarkdown.

I've also been learning Spanish for several years now. To improve my writing skills, I will try to write every post in
both English and Spanish. It's a lot of work, but I think it will be worth it.
I can't guarantee my spelling or grammar will be perfect, so please feel free to contact me for corrections.

# About this blog

I started this blog in late 2017 to early 2018. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience to set up.
I use Pelican to create and organize it. I also use some scripts to manage my workflow.
Soon, I'll make a proper tutorial about how I made this site, from start to finish.
For now, you can find useful files I use to make this site on [my GitHub](https://github.com/maazinansari/maazinansari).

I plan on doing a lot with this site. Stay tuned!
